                <h4>Programming Language</h4>
                <p>As a web developer I had to learn some languages to make myslef perfect. But now I'm in learning
                    process. I belive if I work hard then its possible to learn some languages. and of course Javascript
                    is my first priority.</p>

                <h4>Basic concept of Color</h4>
                <p>To be a good front end developer I must keep knowledge about color so that I can use them. Color is
                    so important for a website to make it more beautiful. It's a makeup for a website. So it's really
                    need to use a good color combination</p>

                <h4>Perfect coding</h4>
                <p>I think if someone did a well organised code then it's easy to modify it future. we need to make it
                    clear and understandable so that people who will edit this, understand well.</p>
